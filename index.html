<p>
  <strong>What kind of Sorcerer are you?</strong>
  Below is a lot of information, to help figure that out.
  Feel free to read from all the different categories, you may be a mix of different kinds of sorceries.
  A martial academic sorcerer, perhaps, or one that has both learned Common Sorcery, and has imbued themselves with the powers of the Soil.
</p>

<p>
  At the end, you may have a unique skill for your character, if they possess sorcerous abilities that can be merged together into
  a single relevant sorcery skill. It is also possible, otherwise, to have multiple skills for different kinds of Sorcery.
  Maybe you learned a few abilities through Common Sorcery, and later went on to become an expert Bardic Sorcerer,
  meaning there would be a disparity between your ability to wield Common Sorcery and Musical spells.

                You learned Sorcery through the most common means, via the tricks and shared sorcerous knowledge of the common folk
                around you. It is the easiest to recognize and learn sorcery, as well as the most widespread.
                It allows for a wide range of abilities, such as telekinesis, kinemancy as a whole, illusory tricks,
                thought reading and influencing, as well as detection, healing abilities, the list goes on.
                <br><br>
                The extent of each of these abilities is limited to what sorcerous abilities are intuitive and common enough that
                they would be known to the common folk, but due to their easy to learn nature and widespreadness,
                it is easier to learn a wide range of common sorcerous abilities, and the possibility to master these abilities remain.

                You learned Sorcery through extensive practice from an expert tutor or an academy.
                This allowed you to master your sorcerous abilities more in depth and specialize.
                Only via academic sorcery can one spend the time to master more powerful common abilities,
                or the less common ones such as invocation, evocation, transformation, and more.
                <br><br>
                To focus on these abilities, one must not necessarily sacrifice their other abilities,
                but they must at least sacrifice time and effort that they could have spent learning other, more basic, sorcerous abilities.

              <p class="sub-category-text">
                You learned Sorcery via the unique means of Rhythm and Melody; Music. Musical Sorcerers, colloquially called
                Bardic Sorcerers, or just <i>‘bards’</i>, are capable of harnessing sorcerous powers through the music that they play.
                It takes a unique, but learnable, intuition to learn this type of sorcery.
                <br><br>
                The powers of Musical Sorcery are varied,
                and usually centered around the mind rather than the physical world. Mainly, a Musical Sorcerer
                has the ability to affect the minds around them and their own as well, through the continuous playing
                of melody and/or rhythms. They can evoke all sorts of emotions, memories and thoughts.
                They can also affect sensations, and as such make for good illusory tricksters, but they can also use this power in a more
                honest manner, such as by alleviating the physical pain of another.

                    Another, different branch of Musical Sorcery, involves lore and ways to retrieve them with careful, irregular,
                    incredibly difficult to master, melodies. Those competent in Musical Lore Sorcery can attune the right melody
                    to the right story, to the right statement, or to the right truth. Another Bard can then relive what the melody
                    is supposed to tell if they are able to play it.
                    <br><br>
                    While quite obscure, and repudiated by many historians,
                    Musical Lore Sorcery can be incredibly powerful, particularly in the ability of a single melody to give
                    the hint of other melodies, that can themselves contain more melodies. Hence, a Lore Bard can retrieve
                    much knowledge by simply playing an instrument, knowledge which might have been completely lost to the world otherwise.

                You learned Sorcery as a fighter. This means that, unlike most other sorcerers, you learned the specificities
                of your sorcerous abilities so that they are most effective in combat; that is, at dealing deadly or crippling
                damage to an enemy.
                <br><br>
                The most common type of Sorcery employed for combat is Kinemancy, learning the power of momentum
                to hurt and kill, but more elite warriors generally learn to use invocations and evocations to summon shields, weapons,
                barricades and others that can help them fight. There are of course, besides that, countless ways to use sorcery for combat,
                which anyone can learn specifically.

                Elemental Sorcerers imbue themselves with an element of the world to learn to harness it. Usually,
                this involves fusing the body and the mind with that element in some process, most often obscure and esoteric,
                and usually harmful or even potentially deadly.
                <br><br>
                Examples include Pyromancers, who can wield fire and heat and other
                sorcerous powers revolving around the ideas of fire and heat; Metal Sorcerers, who can purify and detect metal;
                Terramancers who are able to control the soil over time,
                changing its shape or rendering it more fertile; the list goes on, from elements of the earth and the world, the specific
                folk-made objects or constructions such as refined metal or wheels, to other more esoteric aspects of nature such as hunger
                or hunting.

                Summoners imbue themselves with the memory and the concept of one particular entity, so that they may be able to summon it
                nearly at will. It is an arduous process that requires continuous focus on an entity, until it has become entirely ethereal
                through the sheer power of sorcerous focus.

                Some summon swords, others summon food, yet others summon poison.
                Far more rarely, there are those who are capable of summoning entities akin to living beings.

                  Perhaps the fundamental forces of the universe gave you these powers, or perhaps they were given

                  - or cursed you - with these powers. Is it Chaos Sorcery, the uncontrollable powers of unpredictability itself,
                  given to you because of your turbulent mind in a turbulent life, that you wield? Is it Light Sorcery,
                  given to you by the Sun Deity, or perhaps the Sun itself? Did you unlock unknown powers of the mind through a
                  unique moment of lucidity when you were close to death from starvation? Regardless of what it is,
                  fate seemed to have it in store for you.
